Abstract:	In a mesocosm experiment Zostera marina plants were exposed to nutrient limitation and inoculation with the protist Labyrinthula zosterae in a fully crossed design. 2 days post inoculation and 20 days post abundance of Labyrinthula zosterae within eelgrass tissue were determined by real-time quantitative PCR, together with gene expression of 15 targeted genes. Further we analysed wasting disease symptoms over the course of 20 days and determined eelgrass growth parameters as leaf growth rate, biomass production, leaf and shoot production.
